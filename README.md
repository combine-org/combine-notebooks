# combine-notebooks

## Project Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase COMBINE standards and their libraries around one common theme; the repressilator model.

## COMBINE Standards

- Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN): Used to describe visually biological knowledge.
- Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML): Used for representing models of biological processes.
- Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML): Used for encoding experiments. SED-ML allows defining the models to use, the experimental tasks to run, and which results to produce. It is a computer-readable format for representing the models of biological processes.
- CellML: Used to store and exchange computer-based mathematical models.
- Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL): Used for description and the exchange of synthetic biological parts, devices, and systems.
- NeuroML: Used for XML based description language that provides a common data format for defining and exchanging descriptions of neuronal cell and network models.
